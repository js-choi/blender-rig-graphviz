Contributing guide
==================

Hey, thanks for helping out with the project.

Iâ€™m J.Â S. Choi. I created this Blender add-on in my free time. But itâ€™s not my
day job, and my main focuses are family and work stuff, both of which are
unrelated to Blender.

Bearing that in mind, I appreciate that youâ€™re willing to invest a little time
in this yourself. Just remember that I might not be able to respond for a while
or a long time. It depends on my free time. My apologies in advance if this
happens; Iâ€™ll do my best to get to you. ðŸ™‚

If you have a question or a feature request, please open a GitHub discussion
thread.

If youâ€™re trying to report a bug, please check if there is a GitHub issue
already about the bug. If there is not, then open an issue with your bug report.
Please be as detailed about your bug as you can. Ideally, youâ€™d attach a Blender
file that reproduces your issue.

If you want to contribute code or fix some documentation, please open a pull
request. Keep in mind that this project is licensed under the GNU Affero General
Public License 3.0.

Please also glance at this projectâ€™s `code of conduct <CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst>`,
keeping in mind that we are all volunteers with different backgrounds. (If you
have a concern that someone isnâ€™t following the code of conduct, you can contact
me at <jschoi@jschoi.org> and I will do my best to respond, time permitting.)

Thank you again!
